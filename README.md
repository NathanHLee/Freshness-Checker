# Overview

This application will let the user store any groceries they purchase into the database along with the expiration date. The program will calculate how many days left until the given expiration date hits. If a product is expired, the text will change letting you know how many days past the given product is. 
The purpose of this application is to provide the user with a convienent way to show spoilage in their fridge.

# Relational Database

One column displays the name of the purchased food. 
One displays the date purchased. 
One displays the expiration date. 
And the Last column displays how many days until the expiration date hits.

# Development Environment

I used sqlite3 in python to accomplish this application

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Make the 'Expired!' text a different colour to emphasise that you should consider throwing it out.
* Set a warning when new items appear on the 'close to spoiling' page
